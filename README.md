## Overview
The About Me Generator is a website generator that allows entreprenuers, students, and individuals to create a simply anonymous website that requires simple details without the overwhelming options and services that you may need to log into.

## Features
- Light/Dark modes
- API
- Vcard export and more...

### Technologies involved...
This project serves as the last project in the Holberton School Foundations curriculum, hence, we were supposed to use a lot of technologies we had used in the past along with a couple of extra technologies from past experiences.
The technologies used to build this project include:
- Python (Flask) to setup the databases and generate/stream JSON backend.
- SQLite as a simple database to pull and push data to due to its lightweight resource usage.
- PHP to process inputs/modifications suggested by the admin page.
- Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/JS to generate the overall final page as well as add extra functionality.
